Developing an Intelligent Agent about Oceans and their Continents...!

The main objective behind developing this intelligent agent which could answer the queries related to the oceanography topic like oceans and their location of the continents in the environmental studies. Knowledge of oceans and continents is mandatory in this modern era, as this is very needful to all students as it is an important subject to know about the oceans and continents on the earth . The intelligent agent we are building could be able to answer queries related to the oceans and continents and their related stats. 

Web Application Interface Design : 

We have designed a web application here software able to handle inputs either from the speech or as the text inputs (Like through spoken English and Written English too )as the preference would be given to the user according to our choice.
The tools we used to build this web application is HTML , CSS and JavaScript. 

We have developed a software which is able to answer questions in English: either through spoken or written questions,
A key intelligent behavior of our software is from non-trivial automated reasoning through ASP/SPARC and non-trivial ASP/SPARC rules were involved.

Techniques / method behind the Agent -
• Develop a Web Application
• Speech Recognization / Speech to Text conversion
• ASP Solver 
• Natural language processing
